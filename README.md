This repository is for code designed for devices that can measure voltage, current, or more for circuit analysis.

# Five Channel Volt Meter
This code is written in the Arduino IDE. As the name suggests, it's purpose is to be able to measure voltage from 5 distinct channels. To measure voltages larger than 3.3 volts, the circuit for it uses voltage dividers and uses the resistor ratios to multiply the voltage read to get closer to the actual input voltage.
